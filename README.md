# Pakistan Historical Publications Dataset 
This respository includes two datasets. One is all literary books, including poems, fictions, etc., published in West Pakistan (before 1971) from 1947 to 1962. The attributes include **author**, **publisher**, **page**, **price**, **language**, **genre**, etc. The source is *National Bibliography of Pakistan, 1947-1962*.
The second dataset includes all historical major publishers and booksellers, most of which opened during the 1950s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. The useful attributes include year, whether publisher or not, name, address, type, owner.  
I utilized this dataset for my MA thesis at University of Chicago to visualize the economic situations of the publishing industry in West Pakistan at the time.
