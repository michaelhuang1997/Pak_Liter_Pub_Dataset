# Pakistan Literary Publications Dataset 
This dataset is all literary books, including poems, fictions, etc., published in West Pakistan (before 1971) from 1947 to 1962. The attributes include **author**, **publisher**, **page**, **price**, **language**, **genre**, etc. The source is *National Bibliography of Pakistan, 1947-1962*.
I utilized this dataset for my MA thesis at University of Chicago to visualize the economic situations of the publishing industry in West Pakistan at the time.
